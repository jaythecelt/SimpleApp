# SimpleApp - To demonstarte a severe bug in Android Things Dev Preview 6.1
This app demonstrates sluggish UI response with Android Things Dev Preview 6.1 running on i.MX7 (PICO-PI-IMX7-STARTKIT).

The bug was reported here: https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/70974565 and I commented on that bug ticket to indicate that I was seeing the same problem.  This app is another example to illustrate the issue.

## The environment
Hardware is the TechNexion PICO-PI-IMX7 starter kit: https://shop.technexion.com/pico-pi-imx7-startkit.html with the 5 inch display connected, WiFi enabled, no camera attached.  

The IMX7 is flashed with Anrdroid Things Dev Preview 6.1

## The problem
Sluggish UI response when switching activities (takes over 3 seconds to switch activities); response of all views is sluggish - buttons, seek bars, checkboxes, etc...  The original reporter of this bug (no...@gmail.com) tracked the problem down to portriat mode; this example is another confirmation of this analysis. 

## The code
SimpleApp contains two activities, each with some dummy Buttons, SeekBars, Checkboxes and TextViews.  Both activites are set to portrait mode in the app's manifest:

```
<activity android:name=".MainActivity"
          ...
          android:screenOrientation="portrait">
```
and  
```
<activity android:name=".AnotherActivity"
            ...
            android:screenOrientation="portrait">
            
```

The app starts in MainActivity, then after 5 sec runs AnotherActivity.  

Statements in AnotherActivity:onCreate(..) log the execution time of  ```setContentView(R.layout.activity_another)```

## Run the app to observe the problem in Portrait mode
1. Execute the app
2. Observe that MainActivity is in portrait mode.
3. After 5 sec the app switches to AnotherActivity, note that this activity is also in portrait mode.
4. Note the log statement that indicates the execution time of ```setContentView(...)```.  This illustrates the problem that the call to setContentView(...) is taking about 4 sec.
Ex:  
```I/AnotherActivity: =========== onCreate call to setContentView took: 4.125 sec ========```  
5. Move the SeekBars, press the Buttons and Checkbox; note the sluggish response  
  

## Run the app to observe the problem does not exist in Landscape mode
1. In the app's mainfest change to landscape mode:  
```
<activity android:name=".MainActivity"
          ...
          android:screenOrientation="landscape">
```
and  
```
<activity android:name=".AnotherActivity"
            ...
            android:screenOrientation="landscape">
            
```
2. Observe that MainActivity is in landscape mode.
3. After 5 sec the app switches to AnotherActivity, note that this activity is also in landscape mode.
4. Note the log statement that indicates the execution time of ```setContentView(...)```.  Compare this time with the above execution time in portrait mode.  
Ex:  
```I/AnotherActivity: =========== onCreate call to setContentView took: 0.341 sec ========```  
5. Move the SeekBars, press the Buttons and Checkbox; note the response is as expected.

# Summary
Switching activites in *portrait mode* took 3.314 sec and the UI response to touches was very slow.  After changing the activites to *landscape* and rerunning the app; switching activities took 0.324 sec and the UI response was as expected.
